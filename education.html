                        <h2>What is a Lunar Eclipse?</h2><!--submitting a Lunar Eclipse section to have something to put in the article section-->

                        <p>
                            During a lunar eclipse, Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the sunlight falling on the Moon.
                            There are two kinds of lunar eclipses:
                        </p>

                        <ul> 
                            <li>Partial Lunar Eclipse</li>
                            <li>Total Lunar Eclipse</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            During some stages of a lunar eclipse, the Moon can appear reddish. This is because the only remaining sunlight reaching the Moon at that point is from around the edges of the Earth, as seen from the Moon's surface. From there, an observer during an eclipse would see all Earth's sunrises and sunsets at once.
                        </p>

                        "The moon goes through different phases as it orbits the Earth. These phases are caused by the changing positions of the moon, Earth, and sun. The moon has four primary phases: new moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter. Each phase has its own unique characteristics and significance."
